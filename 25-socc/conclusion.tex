Confidentiality in the cloud is not a priority for everyone.
For whatever reason, end-users don't always think about their data as being vulnerable when in the hands of a cloud provider.
This is mainly due to a misplaced trust in cloud providers, due to two possible reasons.
Potentially, users unconsciously believe that big cloud companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft either aren't able to see all of your data, or wouldn't ever do anything malicious with it.
It's also possible that users don't think of running code or storing data in the cloud as any different from running code or storing data on your computer, due to a lack of technical understanding.
In either case, it seems clear to us that the public underestimates the security risks of the cloud.
Therefore, it is important to make advancements in cloud security that push the envelope and grow the ecosystem of options availibile to make the cloud confidential.
By protecting confidentiality across FaaS replicas, and integrity in FaaS chains, all while \textit{reducing} the TCB, we believe SAMBA moves the field in that direction.

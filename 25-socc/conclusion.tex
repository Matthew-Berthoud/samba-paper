As Mark Russinovich, CTO of Microsoft Azure, famously stated, in the future,
``confidential computing will just be computing.''
%
Realizing this vision requires rethinking today's software systems to make
confidential computing practical and accessible.
%
This thesis takes a first step by bringing confidentiality to a widely used
model---Function as a Service---while maintaining compatibility with existing
applications through our system, \SystemName.
%
\SystemName demonstrates that trusted hardware alone is not enough to satisfy
the complex requirements of modern software systems.
%
Instead, combining trusted hardware with cryptographic
techniques---specifically, proxy re-encryption in \SystemName's case---enables
secure and scalable solutions.
%
To support future work, we have made our \SystemName-lite implementation
publicly available at \url{https://github.com/etclab/samba}, along with our
proxy re-encryption library at \url{https://github.com/etclab/pre}.

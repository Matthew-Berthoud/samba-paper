We propose \SystemName, a Function-as-a-Service system that ensures data
confidentiality and function order within a function chain, even with an
untrusted cloud provider or distrusting parties.
%
%%\SystemName leverages AMD SEV-SNP trusted execution environments to create
%%secure function sandboxes, and uses aggregate signatures for control flow
%%integrity.

To enable scaling and replication without a trusted key escrow, Samba employs
proxy re-encryption, allowing any function replica to decrypt messages for its
target function.

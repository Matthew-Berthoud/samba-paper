% This template file contains packages and commands that are useful and generic
% across papers.
%
% When adding new commands, you can most likely do that within paper.tex, but
% when adding new packages, you might need to update that here to ensure the
% packages are included in the proper order (a common source of compilation
% errors with LaTeX).

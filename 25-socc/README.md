This is based on [SoCC '24](http://acmsocc.org/2024/)


- Full Research Papers (12 pages + unlimited references)
    Describe original research, where novelty is a primary consideration.
    
- Short Research Papers (6 pages + unlimited references)
    Short submissions are reviewed to the same standards as
    the full research papers and differ primarily in scope.
    A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly
    evaluated, just like in a full-length submission.


- Formatting: Research papers must follow the ACM
Proceedings Format, using either the sample-sigconf.tex
provided at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template
for LaTeX (version 2e) or Word, respectively. We require
9pt font size for paper submission. The LaTeX template
should be used as follows: 

```
\documentclass[sigconf, anonymous]{acmart}.
```

The margins, inter-column spacing, and line spacing in the
templates must be kept unchanged. Any submitted paper
violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements
will be rejected without review. Judicious use of color is
permitted, but the paper should print clearly in black and
white.

- Paper type: As a subtitle, papers should indicate the
  submission type (e.g., research, industry, vision,
  work-in-progress).


- File type: Each research paper is to be submitted as a
  single PDF file, formatted for 8.5" x 11" paper and no
  more than 10 MB in file size. (Larger files will be
  rejected by the submission site.) Submitted papers
  must print without difficulty on a variety of printers,
  using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of
  the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file
  renders correctly.
